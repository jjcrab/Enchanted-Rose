## User Stories

### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want to play this enchanted-rose game and guess what word(s) computer has assigned to me. Each letter is represented by a blank spot with a underscore. It can be one word or multiple words. If multiple words, each word will need to be separated by a space so I know how many words I am guessing.
- As a player, I want to guess word(s) from four categories: Disney Characters, Disney Movies, Disney Princesses, and Countries.
- As a player, I want the rose have 7 petals so that I can have 7 chances to guess the word(s). Each time if I guess a wrong letter, one petal will fall, and if I guess a right letter, nothing will change.
- As a player, I want the right letters I picked show in the right spot in the blank spaces. If the word(s) has multiple the right letter I picked, it should show this letter in all the right spots.
- As a player, I want a keyboard with all 26 letters so that I can click the letters when I am guessing. And the keyboard shows different colors of what I have selected so I don't need to remember or write the letters down in a paper. The ones are in the words show red and the ones I picked but not in the words show grey.
- As a player, I want to guess different word(s) each time.
